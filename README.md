## Clarke & Wright Savings 
*A small Python package that provides all the instruments to quickly implement your own Clarke &amp; Wright Savings heuristic algorithm*

-----------------------------------------------------------------

#### End users
This repository is supposed to be useful for people who have to quickly implement the Clarke &amp; Wright Savings algorithm or a similar version inspired by it.

The main elements are:
- the main 'ClarkeWrightSavings' class representing the algorithm instance;
- the 'CWSConfiguration' class representing a particular configuration of parameters;
- the 'Edge' and 'Node' classes from which the respective new implementations have to inherit.
